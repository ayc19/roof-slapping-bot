# Roof slapping bot client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

frontend client for roof slapping bot. Site is up and running [here](http://roof-slapping-bot.surge.sh/)

The program uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to make get requests to the [roof-slapping-bot-api](https://github.com/ayc19/roof-slapping-bot-api). 

On getting the text, the code simply displays the text above the roof flapping car salesman meme.
